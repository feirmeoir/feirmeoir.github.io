# Feirm - Simple farm management Android App

Feirm app allows you to track animal events on the go (Sales, Births, Deaths, Animal Health) and auto-generates reports for you based on that data to make filling out paperwork super easy.

Made in Ireland by an organic sheep farmer so it's built to work.
